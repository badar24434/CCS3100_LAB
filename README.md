# CSC3100\_LAB: Problem Solving and Programming Concepts

This repository hosts the lab exercises and example code for the **CSC3100 — Problem Solving and Programming Concepts** course at **Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)**.

-----

## Course Overview

**CSC3100** is a foundational core course in the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology. It is designed to equip students with essential **problem-solving techniques** and **fundamental programming concepts**.

This course serves as the bedrock for subsequent technical subjects and is a prerequisite for more advanced courses, such as **CSC3101 (Object-Oriented Programming)**.

### **Learning Goals**

  * Build **systematic problem-solving skills**.
  * Learn basic programming constructs (e.g., **variables**, **control flow**, **functions/methods**).
  * Understand simple algorithm design and data structures.
  * Prepare effectively for object-oriented programming and advanced courses.

-----

## Repository Purpose and Structure

### **Purpose**

The primary function of this repository is to:

  * Provide all official **lab exercises** and **example code** for the CSC3100 course.
  * Serve as a comprehensive resource by uploading **lab solutions** after assignment deadlines, allowing students to review and learn from correct implementations.

### **Example Repository Structure**

The source code and files will be organized systematically:

```
CCS3100_LAB/
├── src/
│   └── LAB1/
│       └── Student.java
├── README.md (This file)
```
